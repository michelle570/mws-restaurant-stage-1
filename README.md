# Restaurant Reviews App
---
Created for Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree
## Overview and Project Challenge
For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. You will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### How to run the application

GitHub Pages: [Restaurant Reviews](https://michelle570.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/)
#### Locally
1. Download or clone the git repository `https://github.com/michelle570/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git` into your computer. In Terminal navigate to the root folder.
2. In terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`.  
  * If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) F
  * or Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`.
  * If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
